	7. [[GENERAL PLETHORA]]: overweight, cellulite
	    

## Preparation  

**Use:** Artichoke leaf is decocted or taken in tincture form. Artichoke root works more strongly on the liver than does the leaf.  

## Dosage: 

**Decoction:** 8-14 g

**Tincture:** 2-6 ml at 1:2 strength in 35% ethanol  

**Caution:** Artichoke leaf may clog up breast milk in new mothers. Otherwise none.

## Notes

In Mediterranean countries, especially in Italy, Artichoke leaf and root for millennia played the part that Dandelion and Chicory root played in central Europe—as a remedy for the liver. Today, assisted by the valuable clinical differentiations of Oriental medicine, we can be more precise and specify exactly which aspects of liver functioning Artichoke will help. After all, there are numerous excellent liver remedies available today with a wide range of effecis on liver functioning.

Energetic pharmacology can once again be our  guiding light here. Artichoke leaf is considerably sweet and bitter in taste, with a slight salty fade-out quality. In the context of its selective affinity for the liver, these taste qualities signal restorative or nutritive (sweet), stimulant (bitter) and detoxicant or softening (salty) actions on this organ. Arti­choke’s restorative action is corroborated by the action of its comoound cynarin, whixch is known to en-hance the regeneration and protection of liver cells. The very high content in trace minerals, enzymes and protides also support the view that this herb is a liver trophorestorative, a true nutri­tive to liver cells.

As a result, Artichoke emerges as an important remedy for the liver Yin. Like Milk thistle seed and Astragalus root, this thistle variety also helps the liver in processing and storing nutrients, and to neutralize toxins—all anabolic liver Yin functions. In this sense we have the finest Western equivalent to the major Chinese remedy for liver Yin defici­ency, Prepared rehmannia root (at the end of this section). Being also high in inulin, Artichoke leaf in particular addresses metabolic disorders invol­ving the glycogen cycle. There are resonances here with Chicory root, Dandelion root, Elecampane root and Atractylodes Bai Zhu—all hypoglycemiants that contain inulin.

The bitter stimulant effect of Artichoke leaf is supported by the knowledge that cynarin, together with other constituents, exerts a major choleretic action. By helping the body produce more bile, the remedy stimulates catabolic liver Yang functions of initiating intestinal digestion and of mobilizing nutrients into the bloodstream. Like Blessed thistle, for example, Artichoke is appropriate for liver Yang deficiency causing liver Qi stagnation with its familiar signs and symptoms of liver congestion. 

Because it promotes anabolism and nourishes the blood first and foremost, Artichoke leaf is primarily anasiative by nature. However, as with most plants, its catabolic aspect does include some useful actions. The leaf has shown to lower blood levels of lipids, triglycerides and uric acid, and to help dissolve hard deposits—gallstones in particu­lar. Its diuretic, antilipemic and antilithic actions together have earned it good repute for individuals with general plethora presenting edema, over­ weight, cellulite and spiking cholesterol/triglyce- nde levels. Hematogenic/ Brown Iris types stand to benefit the most from Artichoke’s triple-pronged resolvent, dissolvent and detoxicant action. 

In addition, Artichoke also influences endo­crine thyroid and pancreas functions to monitor and regulate its very earthy, blood-bound, liver-focused metabolic actions  

Another brilliant piece of the Artichoke puz­zle: the remedy has been shown to increase the turnaround time of cell renewal. The implication is nothing less than an aging-retardant effect. The humble Artichoke leaf may yet turn out to be more than a Mediterranean type of Rehmannia. Who knows? It may soon find itself in the big league of the life-extension remedies in Class 7.
