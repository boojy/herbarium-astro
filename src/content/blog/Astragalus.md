## Preparation  

**Use**: The root Astragalus Huang Qi is used in decoction or tincture form. Both preparations are equally good, as the root’s constituents are highly water soluble.  

## Dosage: 

**Decoction**: 10-20 g; up to 60 g in severe cases

**Tincture**; 2-5 ml at 1:2 strength in 25% ethanol  

**Caution**: Contraindicated in heat conditions, including external full heat; in Qi stagnation with intestinal (Spleen) damp, the early stage of boils and abscesses, and in nursing mothers.

## Notes

The Mongolian milkvetch is a perennial nerb with a long taproot from North-Central China and Inner Mongolia. Favoring a warm to cool dry climate and thick, fertile, well-drained sandy humus soil, it grows in windy grassland, sunny slopes and forest margins, and by brush and roadsides. In summer it bears pale yellow flowers on axillary racemes. This unpresumptious plant today furnishes a root that has established a firm presence among the tincture bottles of Western herbalists.

Chinese doctors have used Astragalus root since earliest times for treating weak or deficiency conditions involving metabolic or digestive dys­ functions. They summarised these in the concept “Qi deficiency.” As a result of contemporary research, this remedy’s reputation continues to spike—and deservedly so. For one thing, Astra­ galus root has shown to enhance cellular meta­ bolism, thereby making more energy available on cellular and individual levels. This definitely quali­ fies as an adaptogenic function. It has also shown to be an adrenocortical restorative for loss of stamina, chronic fatigue and so on. It also enhances humoral immune functioning in several ways— including increasing leukocytic interferon produc­ tion, reticuloendothelial phagocytic activity and lymphocytic rosette formation (Chang and But 1987). The root’s polysaccharides content has been demonstrated to be active in this respect. Astraga­ lus is therefore an immune enhancer if used in chronic immunodeficiency conditions, and a short-term immunostimulant anti-infective when used for cold-type infections in immune-comp- romised individuals. In the latter capacity it has shown to be antigenic, leukocytogenic, phagocyte stimulant and antibacterial.

On the other hand, flavonoids and amino acids are involved with Astragalus root’s excellent liver restorative and liver protective actions. These acti­ ons entail enhanced hepatic assimilation, storage and detoxification, along with an increase in liver protein synthesis. Liver Yin deficiency syndromes —with their telltale symptoms of loss of stamina, exhaustion in the evening and infection-prone­ ness—stand to benefit here. They are also hormon­ally supported by a crucial tandem adrenocortical restorative action.

Astragalus root’s generous content in saponins indicates a rejuvenating action on red blood cells and increased nutrient absorption by the intestin­ es—a digestive restorative action. This includes enhanced calcium and silicon utilization—a big plus for bone strength and an indication for osteo­ porosis prevention. Moreover the root also contains generous amounts of trace minerals, including the important trace elements selenium and molybda- num, which it collects from the soil and stores. Through these twin dynamics, Astragalus will inc­ rease overall vitality, energy and weight gain. The syndrome stomach-intestines (Spleen) Qi defici­ ency—a major indication for this remedy— embo­ dies these restorative actions on metabolism.

It becomes clear why the net result of these various actions has earned Astragalus root the status of Qi tonic, or energy tonic. This mildly sweet, warm, yet dry-natured remedy is a unique and invaluable component in most formulations addressing metabolic and immune deficiency conditions, with or without an overlay of infection.

Because Astragalus root entails a significant detoxicant diuretic effect (saponins at work again), adequate kidney functioning—especially elimina­ tion—is assured. Hence it is routinely included in China today in herbal prescriptions for kidney dis­ orders and rheumatic disorders. Kidney Qi stagna­ tion and metabolic toxicosis here encapsulates both the preclinical and organic kidney-metabolic indications for this depurative remedy.

Although the Pharmacopoeia of the Peoples’ Republic currently only enumerates the two Astra­ galus species listed at the top as correct botanical source for the remedy, traditionally and currently many other species serve as botanical source. Not only that, but a different genus, Hedysarum, with its own several species, also represents the Chinese remedy Huang Qi. Historically the main source for Huang Qi was probably Hedysarum polybotris, which has recently been renamed Hong Qi. Hedysarum Hong Qi has been found equally and similarly as therapeutic as Astragalus Huang Qi.
