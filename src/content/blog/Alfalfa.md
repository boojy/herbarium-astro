	1. [[CAPILLARY FRAGILITY]], [[spontaneous bleeding]]
	    

## Preparation  

**Use**: Alfalfa herb is prpared by infusion, powder, tablet and tincture.

Taken before eating, Alfalfa assists digestion by ensuring appropriate gastric secretions. Taken with or after a meal, it promotes nutrient absorption, especially of calcium and protein, and helps colonic peristalsis. Alfalfa’s benefits, other than those connected with digestion, are enhanced when taken in­ between meals. The remedy can and should be taken continuously for the deficiency conditions it treats.

Alfalfa is a safe nutritive herb and can be taken throughout pregnancy. It is especially valuable after 34 weeks to ensure adequate vitamin K provision to the baby. It is also an excellent blood-buliding nutritive during the first two weeks of postpartum.  

## Dosage: 

**Infusion**: 8-16 g

**Tincture**: 4-6 ml at 1:3 strength in 30% ethanol 

**Caution**: None

## Notes

Alfalfa has a rich history as a nutritive herb since earliest days of traditional Greek medicine, or al tibb e al yunnani. The beauty of Alfalfa’s luminous blue flowers prompted ancient Persians to name the plant lazwardija, azure blue. This refers to the deeply saturated blue glaze these craftsmen used in ceramic work. With the medieval Islamic expan­ sion to the West, Arabic physicians and pharma­ cists brought this “father of all foods” to Spain during the Al-Andalus period, from where it spread to the rest of Europe. The dissemination of Alfalfa, along with many other herbs and spices, is one of the brilliant legacies of the near-legendary Al-Andalus culture. A unique hybrid of Arabic, Jew­ish and Spanish culture that strongly resonates with us once again in the multi-ethnic global societies of today’s large metro areas.

Alfalfa is an important medicinal food, an anastative nutritive that (in Ayurvedic terms) increas­es kapha, thereby promoting strength, solidity and weight gain. These are all typical of an increase of Spleen Qi/Yin and liver Yin in Chinese medicine. This major digestive remedy will increase assimi­lation, protect the stomach lining and regulate gas­ tric acidity. Nutritional disorders in general benefit from its wide range of actions. To its advantage, Alfalfa is not an oily remedy and so will not pro­ duce Qi stagnation like some Chinese Blood and Yin tonics. Its content in enzymes, amino acids, vitamins, electrolytes and trace elements ade­ quately ensures this.

By systemically altering and regulating the internal environment, Alfalfa herb is also recog­nized today as a metabolic enhancer and regulator for chronic and degenerative disorders in general. Alfalfa’s wide gamut of components ensures a combined resolvent, detoxicant and dissolvent action that goes hand in hand with its primary nutritive function. In this sense it is the inverse of Celery seed. The saponins and phytoestrogens help lower blood lipid levels (an antilipemic action) and one of its proteins is considered antitumoral. The remedy has also shown liver and small intestine- protective activity, especially when caused by che­ mical damage. Milk thistle seed take note. These are just some examples of the mechanisms invol­ ved in its systemic detoxicant effect.

In recent years a bivalent regulating effect has also been noted (empirically and scientifically) with regards to the hormone estrogen. The reme­dy’s content in phytoestrogens has shown the abili­ ty to either increase estrogen production (an estro­ genic action) or to decrease it (an antiestrogenic action). As is speculated of several traditional uterine restoratives, including Dong quai root, the very action of phytoestrogens binding with estra­ diol receptors can potentially increase or decrease a woman’s endogenous estrogen production—in the latter case by simply reducing the availability of receptor sites.

Since those days, however, Alfalfa herb sadly has been more important as cattle fodder than as remedy because of the neglect of treatment meth­ ods such as nourishing, altering and promoting nutrient absorption (i.e., strengthening the Spleen). Greek medicine in its later European phase unfor­ tunately favored elimination by whatever means as a treatment method. This is evident in the progres­ sively stronger purgatives, diaphoretics and eme­ tics that were used from the sixteenth century on­ wards. Even when it aspired to regulate the fluids in the presence of blatant fluids dyskrasia (meta­ bolic toxicosis), Galenic doctors sought to do so in terms of eliminant techniques and the resultant amount of toxins evoked. The possibility of regula­ ting a fluid dyskrasia by purely qualitative- means, by simply altering pathogenic processes, never entered their minds. With its slow-acting, undra- matic effects, Alfalfa herb would therefore not have been used as an evacuant remedy. Because of current health-care needs, this muti-faceted regula­ting remedy is once again certainly indicated today.
