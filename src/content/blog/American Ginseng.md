## Notes

American ginseng root was first discovered in 1716 north of Montreal, Canada, by the Jesuit mission­ ary, father Frangois Lafiteau. Over time, its reputa­ tion grew to become the most highly sought after Western remedy in use by Chinese doctors throughout East Asia. By the turn of the nineteenth century, Chinese sea ports collectively were recei­ ving over 400,000 pounds annually of the dried “Tartar roots” from the North American continent.

Like several other remedies used in both Western and Chinese herbal medicine, American ginseng root represents an interesting interface between the two systems. It invites a dialogue between the therapeutic orientation of the Oriental system and the pharmacological orientation of the Western one (traditional and modem). This dialo­ gue is now possible, since biochemical research has established a biochemical value for this root. Essentially, modern research has found in the American species the same and other similar glycosides and adaptcgens as in the Asian (Chinese and Korean) species, but in a lesser proportion. Japanese ginseng also has a closer biochemical profile to the American species.

Although used for centuries by Native Ameri­ cans (supposedly by the Senecas, Cherokees, Menominees and Penobscots), white settlers never esteemed this “Cherokee root” beyond the status of just another domestic medicine for first-aid diges­ tive uses. In the days of dramatic eliminating and stimulating therapies, the unobtrusive restoring, relaxing and strengthening Ginseng never had a chance to exhibit its superlative effectiveness for chronic weak or deficiency conditions.

Even Native Americans apparently did not make much use of American ginseng. Cherokees in Georgia were one of the few peoples acquainted with the root—although they are said to have reco­gnised its restorative qualities. Eclectic practition­ers too underestimated American ginseng’s impor­tance for chronic disorders. They were quite right in declaring it a “mild sedative and tonic to the nerve centers,” advising its use for “the failure of digestion incident to nervous prostration and gene­ral nerve irritation.” A practitioner as prominent as Ellingwood, however, still felt the need to add, “If combined with other tonics [it] is capable of doing some good.” More importantly, Eclectic physicians may have missed the central point of restorative remedies in general. They failed to consider treating the individual ground or biotype for consti­ tutional tendencies to imbalance. From this pers­pective, American ginseng is one of the best cookie-jar tonics for the Earth (Melancholic) and Lung types.

With its bitter-sweet taste qualities, American ginseng root is a classic restorative remedy that spans neuroendocrine, metabolic and digestive functions in one broad stroke. It has many of the properties of the herbs in the previous section. As a neuroendocrine restorative, it treats cerebral defi­ ciency and neurasthenia conditions such as chro­ nic depression, memory loss and insomnia—espec­ ially when caused by chronic overwork or disease. As such, it includeas a systemic adaptogenic effect (in the Breckhman sense), an adrenocortical rest­ orative action and an enhancement of long-term immunity—all of which help reduce the ravages of chronic stress. This makes American ginseng al­ most the perfect “tonic” for today’s urban lifesty­le—unless we want to add a good antioxidant like Ginkgo leaf to help relieve the burden of environ­ mental pollution.

On the metabolic front, American ginseng acts as a superlative gastrointestinal and liver restora­tive. It will address digestive, nutritive and broad­ ly metabolic insufficiencies, as seen in the syndro­ mes stomach-intestines Qi deficiency and liver Yin deficiency. Here the remedy will increase nutrient absorption and digestive efficiency as a whole, and enhance heaptic nutrient storage like the Class 9 hepatic nutritives. Key symptoms here are chronic loss of appetite, weight and energy, as well as lowered defenses to infections in general. Clearly, we are looking at a remedy for chronic weakness and fatigue from both the neuroendo­ crine and metabolic angle. In energetic terms, American ginseng is a pure Qi tonic, one of the best known. It will mirror an acupuncture point selection such as CV 6 and 12, St 36 and Bl 20 and 24 and 38.

From the Chinese perspective, American gin­seng is also valuable for its ability to tonify lung Yin—tuberculous/consumptive conditions with empty heat, chest irritation, dry cough and insom­ nia. This has been an important function in the context of China’s historical healthcare needs.
