## Preparation  

**Use**: Licorice root is prepared by decoction or tincture. The decoction is preferable in hot or hyperacidic gastric conditions (with or without ulcer) and is best taken after meals. For greater intestinal absorption, the sliced root should be toasted first before decocting.

Licorice syrup was and still is a favorite preparation for bronchial conditions. Schroeder’s Dispen­ satory (1611) gives a syrup recipe that is respiratory demulcent, stimulant and restorative combined: Licorice root, Coltsfoot herb, Elecampane root, Hyssop herb, Yarrow herb, Scabious herb, Speedwell herb, Lungwort herb, Meadow saffron petal, Date fruit and Jujube berry.

Washes can be applied to local inflammations. 

## Dosage: 

**Decoction**: 4-12 g

**Tincture**: 1-3 ml at 1:2 strength in 25% ethanol  

**Caution**: Licorice root should be avoided in conditions of adrenal hyperfunctioning such as hypertension, water retention (especially around the heart), hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, and with excess secretions generally (as found in stomach Qi stagnation, for example).

Some individuals are naturally sensitive to Licorice extracts and preparations (such as Licorice candy), laxatives containing a large proportion of Licorice extract, and anti-ulcer medicines made from its concentrated derivatives. For these people, DGL—deglycyrrhizinated Licorice—should be used instead in the treatment of ulcers. However, Licorice root is still a mild remedy with virtually no cumulative toxicity.

## Notes

Licorice root is one of several herbs where Western and Chinese herbal medicinee intersect, resulting in an interesting assortment of uses. Looking over some of the pharmacological and clinical research, it becomes clear that Glycyrrhiza uralensis is inter­ changeable with G. glabra; so any claims about different uses arising from various botanical spe­ cies are unjustified.

In traditional Chinese texts, the emphasis of describing herb functions in a purely phenomen­ ological way comes to the fore. This presents a sharp contrast to the analytical, experimental app­ roach of current Western pharmacy. Nevertheless, when digging back through the Western literature, it becomes apparent that the similar uses of the two Licorice types outweighs their differences. Once again, the key to an integrated approach lies in traditional Greek medicine (TGM). In addition, Western research (which is extensive) fully conso­ lidates Licorice’s position in the Chinese pharma­ copoeia as a Qi tonic.

The difference of approach can easily be app­ reciated. Chinese medicine emphasizes treating stomach-intestines (Spleen) Qi deficiency—i.e., deficient nutrient absorption —with the digestive resorative. Western practice, however, sees its ton­ ing action on the adrenal cortex/medulla, panc­ reas and gonads, a selective endocrine restorative. In both cases, however, the remedy will support individuals with fatigue between meals, loss of appetite and stamina, and sweet cravings—a com­ mon multilateral weak condition. Conditions of hypoglycemia and estrogen deficiency are speci­ fically treated.

Moreover, research on Licorice has shown activity on the pituitary-adrenal axis with a resul­ tant immune-enhancing and immunostimulant effect. This reinforces its status as a full-fledged Qi tonic. As such, Licorice is a remedy for health maintenance in the most complete sense. Short of documenting its complex, comprehensive pharma­ cology, it is clear that the net result of its restoring and regulating effects also might just make Licori­ ce a systemic enhancer of the effective functions of other remedies. Certainly, like many another reme­ dy working on the neuroendocrine level, it can also act to reduce immune hyperactivity or deregu­ lation when this arises from a deeper neuroendoc­ rine-immune incompetence. Astragalus root, Schisandra berry, Elecampane root and, of course, Reishi mushroom also work in this sense, all add­ ressing various stages of hypersensitivity disorders through little understood dynamics.

With its sweet, moist quality, Licorice is very effective for treating dryness, irritability and hypersensitivity of the bronchi, throat, stomach and urinary organs. Here the root’s lenitive, dem­ ulcent and antacid effects prevail over essentially dry conditions, which may involve tissue irritation, inflammation or loss (as in peptic ulcer). Licorice is an important bronchial demulcent, for instance, in syndromes of lung dryness and phlegm-dry­ ness, 'especially with dry cough and viscous spu­ tum. It is also a good sore throat remedy, especi­ ally with hoarseness. Johann Schroeder (1611) devotes quite some space to explaining how and why Licorice “finders the sharpness of urine” (refering to excess uric acid in the urine), “tempers the sharpness of the fluids causing urinary stones” and “heals bladder ulcers.”

Both the Western and Chinese traditions have made use of Licorice’s excellent anti-infective. anti-inflammatory and antiseptic effects for a long time. Presently we also know of its protecting and detoxicant action on liver cells, which highlight its use for infectious hepatitis, for example. Here the root acts in a way similar to Milk thistle and Lov- age root, among others.

Licorice root is commonly added to herbal formulas of all types for two important reasons. First, it has the virtually unique property of harm­ onizing and softening any harshness of the herbs it is combined with, whether their warmth, taste, moisture or toxicity. In this context, and because of its various combined actions (which include immu­ ne stimulation), Licorice is an important antidote and temperer to a variety of toxic plants or their extracted alkaloids, including coffee (caffeine), tobacco (nicotine), coca leaf (cocaine), aconite (aconitine) and vomit nut (strychnine). Moreover, the remedy is a very common ingredient in many formulations not only for this reason, but also be­ cause “it makes them more acceptable to the stom­ ach” (Diers Rau 1968). This again harks back to the Chinese theme of protecting and promoting gastrointestinal functions (Spleen Qi), and especia­ lly nutrient absorption.
