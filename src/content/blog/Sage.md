## Preparation

**Use**: Sage leaf is infused or used in tincture or essential oil form. Drunk hot, Sage infusion is a diapho­ retic for cold and flu onsets with sore throat 01 sinus congestion. The tincture is best in general.

For health maintenance, the daily strong infusion is also a good preparation: keep the tea covered with a lid in Chinese fashion. If, as Rudolf Breuss recommends, the tea is infused or briefly decocted with­ out a lid, Sage’s antiseptic quality diminishes as its essential oil content evaporates in steam. He reports that as a trade-off a ferment essential to the glands, intervertebral discs and bone marrow is released. Certainly, Sage’s astringent properties are also thereby enhanced. (The longer preparation time pushes out the tannins.)

Sage leaf enters into many topical preparations, including washes, liniments, vaginal steams, douches, pessaries, and for gargling. To produce a good gargle, it should be combined with a more tannic remedy like Tormentil root, Selfheal spike or Lady’s Mantle herb.  

## Dosage: 

**Infusion:** 6-12 g

**Tincture**: 1-2 ml at 1:3 strength in 40% ethanol

**Essential oil**: 1 drop in a gel cap topped with some olive oil, once daily 

**Caution**: Being a uterine stimulant and dry astringent, and containing the toxic ketone thujone, Sage leaf is contraindicated throughout pregnancy and nursing. The herb has medium-strength therapeutic status and for long-term use is best used in a formula rather than on its own.

Although Sage essential oil may safely be used daily with frequent five-day breaks (Schnaubelt 1985), because of its thujone content its dosage must not be exceeded. For the same reason, Sage oil is contraindicated to those prone to epileptic seizures.

## Notes

The very name of this plant indicates the unsur­ passed esteem that Sage enjoyed at the time of ecclesiastical European medicine. “Sage” is derived from the Latin word salvus, meaning well­ being. The remedy figures in the opening verses of abbot Walafried Strabo’s twelfth-century work on herbal remedies, and there are some reports that Sage was a main ingredient in longevity prescrip tions of the period. Elixirs of life were routinely concoted during the Middle Ages--in much the same way as in imperial China. The medical verses of the eleventh-century medical college in Salerno (Italy) cryptically state that Sage’s super-tonic effects are only limited by death. Much later, humanist herbalist Hieronymus Bock (1532) praised Sage leaf even more than his beloved Nettle. And in 1688 an amazing 4M-page book covering all then known medical experiences with Sage was written by Danish physician Christian Paullini.

Today we know that Sage’s essential oils affect the pituitary, adrenals and gonads, and enhance non-specific immunity (Durrafourd et al. 1982). With its major neuroendocrine restorative and im­ mune enhancing actions, Sage reaches deeply into the core of human physiology, the higher neuroen­ docrine centers. In vitalistic terms, the remedy is a Qi, blood and Essence tonic. Like the similar Chin­ese herb, Schisandra berry, Sage leaf is for indivi­ duals with classic neurasthenia or neuroendocri­ ne-immune deficiency, with key symptoms of debility and low resistance to infections. Its restor­ ative effects include a toning of the adrenal cortex, the sympathetic nervous system and arterial blood pressure.

Sage also has a time-honored reputation as a gynecological remedy, and this is partly due to its proclivity for hormonal modulation. By stimulating the pituitary-adrenal and pituitary-gonadal axis, Sage exerts an estrogenic action that is tailor-made for the woman with PMS or amenorrhea from gonadal insufficiency with low estrogen. Like the other uterine restoratives in Class 7, Sage will treat uterus blood deficiency with scanty or absent periods, cramps with onset of flow, chronic tired­ ness and low stamina. This all the more so as the herb is considered an emmenagogue on the tissue level, and in some countries was particularly valued for spasmodic dysmenorrhea. Like Winter savory, Sage may also treat infeitility arising from pitui­ tary-gonadal deficiency. During labor, the herb is also oxytocic in facilitating contractions.

In the perimenopausal years, for all th» reas­ ons above, Sage can be a great support for women with general Blood and Qi deficiency presenting exhaustion, low blood pressure, night sweats and hot flashes.  

In terms of its effective qualities, Sage leaf is bitter, pungent and astringent. In terms of the six diagnostic conditions, Sage addresses weak and damp conditions, especially of the reproductive, respiratory and digestive organs. As regards its ability to address damp conditions, Sage exerts a good astringent mucostatic action on a tissue level that resolves congested mucous in the digestive tract with mucousy stool, bloating and diarrhea. In the lungs, the herb is a mucolytic expectorant that is perfect for chronic phlegm-damp bronchial conditions with continuous sputum and congestive wheezing.

Sage’s well-documented restraining effect on excessive sweating—an anhydrotic action, like that of Schisandra berry—should be used clinically in deficient Qi and deficient Yin syndromes. It will be successful not only in menopausal syndrome, but also in the night sweats of chronic low-grade remittent fevers and of lung tuberculosis.

For chronic infections, including throat infec­ tions, and chronic wounds, ulcers and other skin lesions, Sage provides a combination of excellent antiseptic and vulnerary and tissue-repairing properties.
